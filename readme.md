A basic app to show a news feed.

Every minute, the server fetches 7 days worth of data from the news API http://newsapi.org, and saves them to a file.

(note - 8.9.2022, 14:55: there's a bug that the files overwrite each other).

Also, there's a client side that allows watching the news feed and choosing between 20, 50 and 100 pieces.

The tech stack is React, Node, Express.
